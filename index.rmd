A podcast reflection by Katharine MacIntosh

<img src="media/caribou.jpg" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />

I’ve built an identity around being productive and capable. This is who I know myself to be. Anxiety has been the dominant motivating force driving my access to creativity, excitement, and productivity. Just before the semester started, I encountered a traumatic, life-changing event and wasn’t able to sustain motivation through anxiety any longer. Dealing with the resulting trauma was so energetically taxing that any amount of anxiety led to exhaustion rather than motivation, the opposite reaction to which I was accustomed. In addition, this psychological trauma had a physical manifestation, and I was unwell for the majority of the semester. On top of managing the emotional and physical repercussions of depression, I experienced a loss of identity; I simply could no longer maintain the high level of productivity that I felt defined me.

Clearly, taking on an ambitious project under these conditions, I was bound to fail.  However, actually going through the process and watching myself fail and fail and fail, I learned to forgive myself, and dissociate my value from my productivity. This has been another energetically taxing task, but ultimately necessary to maintain my health. My podcast was far from perfect and far from what I had originally envisioned, but the process of creating this podcast was ultimately very closely tied to processing the trauma that resulted from this extremely difficult period.

In the future, I will stick to making maps.

gwichin <- read_sf("media/gwichin-territory.gpkg") %>% 
  mutate(feature = "Gwich'in traditional territory",
         col = "#69D2E7")
territory <- rbind(caribou, gwichin)
pal <- colorFactor(c("#F38630", "#69D2E7"), 
                    c("Porcupine Caribou calving grounds", 
                      "Gwich'in traditional territory"))
leaflet(territory, width = 800, height = 800) %>% 
  addProviderTiles("Esri.NatGeoWorldMap") %>% 
  # polygon from shapefile
  addPolygons(color = ~pal(feature), stroke = FALSE, fillOpacity = 0.75,
              label = ~ feature) %>% 
  # add point directly
   addMarkers(lng = -139.827, lat = 67.569, label = "Old Crow") %>% 
   addLegend("bottomright", pal = pal, values = ~ feature,
    title = NULL,
    opacity = 1

Have built an identity around being productive and capable. This is who I know myself to be, having found a tremendous amount of motivation and energy through a certain level of anxiety. My access to creativity and excitement through anxiety is something I was unable to sustain once I encountered a traumatic, life-changing event. Dealing with this trauma was so energetically taxing that any amount of anxiety led to exhaustion rather than motivation. This exhaustion is the opposite reaction to I was accustomed to and, additionally, led to me being physically unwell for virtually the whole of the semester. In addition to managing the emotional and physical repercussions of depression, this led to a loss of identity that was being further exacerbated as I was still involved in managing the situation that resulted from . Clearly, taking on an ambitious project, I was bound to fail, but actually going through the process and watching myself fail and fail and fail, I’ve had to learn to forgive myself, and dissociate my value from my productivity.
